# Why flutter(Dart)
Single codebase for all platforms (no need to create separate code bases when working on iOS and Android devices)
Reduced development time (The requirements for Flutter application development are much lower)
Increased time to market speed
Powerful and growing community

Limited number of third-party libraries (but for an application like this simple one should not be a problem)
